# Udacity-Landing-Page
The purpose of this project is to manipulate the DOM and construct the User Interface using pure JavaScript. Several tasks for this project included the following: dynamically appending data to the DOM, show how JavaScript can improve the usability of an static site and construct helper functions to make readable code.

## Technologies Used
`HTML5`
`CSS3`
`ES6 JavaScript`

## Instructions
1) Download zip file from this repository and extract data.
2) Run project on the internet browser of your choice.

## Notes
- To see which classes have `your-active-class`, type this command `ctrl + shift + i` to view the html elements in `<main>` tags.
- Helper functions like `addSectionActive`, `removeSectionActive`, `createMenuLink` and many more are used to keep code readable.
- All functions use ES6 arrow functions to make lines of code shorter.
